Controller
- ?? does this have a building object through which to interact with floor and elevator

-creates new person
    if(probHappened(3.5%))
        createPerson(randomSeedValueID(counter), randAssignedFloor(1,50))       // ??where do I write function to create new person?? how do I refer to person class to make object??
       
-determines when a person is ready to leave the floor
    if(probHappened(1.5%))
        setFloorPersonReady(whatFloor, )                                        // ??how do I use an array of booleans for this?? how do I let the elevator know floor is ready for 
                                                                                   pickup?? how do I let the elevator know what ID to scan for?? !! call this on each and every floor !!

-creates the main loop generating ticks                                         // ??how the hell do I create ticks??
-??calls update on each building on each tick??                                 // ??what the hell does this mean??
-??recording and ouputting information??                                        // ??what information needs to be recorded and outputted??

-building object assigned with floor and elevator                               // ??how do I instantiate a floor and elevator object in building?
